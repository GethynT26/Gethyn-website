      <h1>Plastic pollution</h1>
    </center>
    <h2>Why we need to stop plastic pollution</h2>
    <p>
      Plastic pollution has started to become the most pressing environmental
      issue, one of the main reasons is that over the decades, we have been
      increasing plastic generation but not recycling all of that. One of the
      main reasons why we have increased plastic is because of demand from
      countries whose population has increased. Also, in some countries plastic
      pollution is visible because of their garbage collection systems are
      either inefficient or nonexistent. Also when plastic ends up in the ocean, 
      it can entangle and kill marine life, such as birds, fish, and turtles. 
      It can also be ingested by marine life, which can harm or kill them.
    </p>
    <h2>How did this happen</h2>
    <p>
       There was a record of a incident with plastic pollution in 1930.
      scientists were fishing for Plankton and their machine produced lots of
      plastic litter by accident. But creating plastic also has saved us, as
      plastic has created medicine with life-saving technology, saved fuel and
      has saved lives with equipment like helmets. But with this it came with a
      cost of damaging our planet and environment because of how we dispose of
      it.There are several sources of plastic pollution, 
      including single-use plastic items such as straws, bags, and water bottles, 
      as well as larger plastic items like fishing nets and shipping containers. 
      Plastic pollution can also come from the breakdown of larger plastic products 
      over time, releasing small plastic particles into the environment.

    <h2>How does this affect us as the public</h2>
    <p>
      This affects our everyday life, as if you went to the beach there will be
      plastic, and the plastic is dangerous to children as it can cut open their
      feet or they might eat the plastic. This also affects us as we are slowly
      consuming micro plastic. Did you know that an average person consumes
      70,000 plastic a year. Micro plastics entering the human body through direct 
      exposure to plastic pollution may also cause other deadly issues such as oxidative 
      stress, apoptosis, and necrosis. Plastic pollution in oceans impacts the human health too.

  <h2>How we can help</h2>
    <p>
      There are several ways that we can help reduce plastic pollution, including:

  Reducing the use of single-use plastics such as straws, water bottles, and plastic bags <!---->
  Recycling plastic products properly
  Educate others about the issue of plastic pollution and the importance of reducing plastic use.
  Supporting businesses that have environmentally-friendly practices
  Using reusable containers and bags for shopping and storage
  Support businesses that use sustainable packaging materials.
  By taking these steps, we can help protect the environment and reduce the negative impacts of plastic pollution on wildlife and ecosystems.
  recycle plastic when possible
